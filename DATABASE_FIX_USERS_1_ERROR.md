# Fix for "column users_1.username does not exist" Error

## Root Cause Identified
The error was caused by incorrect foreign key references in Supabase queries. The queries were using `users!user_id` but the actual foreign key constraint name is `content_posts_user_id_fkey`.

## Solution Applied
Fixed all occurrences of the incorrect foreign key reference across the codebase.

### Files Fixed:
1. `/lib/services/wolfpack/feed.ts`
2. `/lib/services/wolfpack-realtime.service.ts`
3. `/lib/services/wolfpack-social.service.ts`
4. `/lib/database/posts.ts`
5. `/lib/database/likes.ts`
6. `/lib/database/comments.ts`
7. `/lib/hooks/useRealtimeSync.ts`
8. `/lib/services/comment-reaction.service.ts`

### Change Made:
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
.from("content_posts")
.select(`
  *,
  user:users!user_id(
    username,
    display_name,
    ...
  )
`)

// AFTER (correct):
.from("content_posts")
.select(`
  *,
  user:users!content_posts_user_id_fkey(
    username,
    display_name,
    ...
  )
`)
```

## Why This Fix Works
- Supabase uses the actual foreign key constraint name for joins
- The foreign key from `content_posts.user_id` to `users.id` is named `content_posts_user_id_fkey`
- Using the wrong foreign key name causes Supabase to create an automatic alias (`users_1`) which doesn't have the expected columns

## Additional Fixes Applied
1. Fixed `UserRole` enum references in auth service (changed `MEMBER` and `WOLFPACK_MEMBER` to `USER`)
2. Fixed parameter naming bug in feed service (`getUserPosts` function)

## Testing Required
After applying these fixes:
1. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Restart the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Test video loading functionality
4. Verify user profiles load correctly

## Status
✅ All database schema reference errors have been fixed
✅ The foreign key naming issue has been resolved
✅ The application should now be able to query the database correctly

The "column users_1.username does not exist" error should no longer occur.
