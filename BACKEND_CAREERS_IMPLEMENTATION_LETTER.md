## Implementation Steps (30 Minutes Total)

### Step 1: Database Setup (10 minutes)
```bash
# Execute the SQL file
psql -d your_database < CAREERS_IMPLEMENTATION.sql
```

The SQL file handles:
- âœ… Table creation with proper indexes
- âœ… RLS policy setup
- âœ… Storage bucket configuration  
- âœ… Analytics views creation
- âœ… Sample queries for testing

### Step 2: Storage Bucket Verification (5 minutes)
Verify the `job-applications` bucket was created:
- **Bucket name:** `job-applications`
- **Folder structure:** `resumes/[timestamp]_[firstname]_[lastname]_[filename]`
- **Access:** Private (staff only can view)

### Step 3: Frontend Route Addition (5 minutes)
The careers page is already built at `/app/(main)/careers/page.tsx`
- All components are in `/components/careers/`
- Matches existing project styling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Ready for production

### Step 4: Test Application Flow (10 minutes)
1. Visit `/careers` page
2. Click "Apply Now" on any position
3. Fill out the 4-step application
4. Upload a test resume
5. Verify data appears in `job_applications` table
6. Check file uploads in storage bucket

## Database Schema Highlights

### Main Table: `job_applications`
```sql
-- Core fields that matter for hospitality hiring
position_title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,

-- THE MOST IMPORTANT FIELDS - Personality Assessment
why_this_job TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Why do you want this job?
handle_pressure TEXT NOT NULL,        -- How do you handle pressure?
stay_busy_example TEXT NOT NULL,      -- How do you stay busy during slow periods?

-- File storage
resume_url VARCHAR(500),              -- Path to resume in storage

-- Application management
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, interview, hired, etc.
```

### Built-in Analytics
- **Application stats by position**
- **Monthly hiring trends**
- **Response quality scoring**
- **Applications pending review**

## Key Features That Set This Apart

### ðŸŽ­ Personality-Focused Questions
Instead of asking "What's your greatest weakness?", we ask:
- **"How do you stay productive during slower periods?"** *(Critical for hospitality)*
- **"Describe how you handle pressure during busy rushes"** *(Essential skill)*
- **"Why do you want to work in our fast-paced environment?"** *(Motivation check)*

### âš¡ Industry Reality Check
The application honestly explains:
- **The ups:** Great tips, exciting atmosphere, team camaraderie
- **The downs:** Slow periods, weekend work, difficult customers
- **Our expectation:** People who understand and still love the industry

### ðŸ“Š Smart Data Collection
- **Availability tracking** (weekdays, weekends, evenings, holidays)
- **Transportation verification** (essential for reliability)
- **Experience assessment** (but personality weighted higher)
- **References collection** (for background verification)

## Sample Queries for Immediate Use

### Find High-Quality Applications
```sql
-- Applications with detailed personality responses
SELECT 
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name,
    position_title,
    email,
    why_this_job,
    handle_pressure
FROM job_applications
WHERE 
    LENGTH(why_this_job) > 150 AND
    LENGTH(handle_pressure) > 150 AND
    status = 'pending'
ORDER BY submitted_at DESC;
```

### Get Applications Needing Review
```sql
-- Use the built-in view
SELECT * FROM applications_pending_review
WHERE days_waiting > 2;
```

### Download Resume URLs
```sql
-- Get downloadable resume links
SELECT 
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS name,
    'https://[your-supabase-url]/storage/v1/object/private/job-applications/' || resume_url AS download_url
FROM job_applications
WHERE resume_url IS NOT NULL;
```
