## BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES

Ask yourself:
1. Is this feature currently broken? (If no, DON'T TOUCH IT)
2. Did the user explicitly ask for this change? (If no, DON'T TOUCH IT)
3. Am I "improving" working code? (If yes, DON'T TOUCH IT)

## THE GOLDEN RULE

**If it works, DON'T TOUCH IT unless adding NEW features**

## Track Record of Unnecessary Breaks
- Messaging system broken 3+ times by "improvements"
- Hours wasted on fixing the same issues
- User frustration: MAXIMUM

## How to Add New Features (The RIGHT Way)
1. Confirm existing functionality works
2. Add new feature WITHOUT modifying existing code
3. Test that old functionality still works
4. Document the addition
5. Update this file if needed
